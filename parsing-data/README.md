# Parsing Raw Text Files 

## Description
`parsing-data.ipynb`:

This project focus on the  extraction data from semi-structured text files using only `re` and `pandas` libraries. A lot of interesting functions were created by us in order to accomplish the tasks.

Given a `TXT` file, the goal is to extract the data and transform the data into the `CSV` and `JSON` formats, with the following elements:

1. grant_id: a unique ID for a patent grant consisting of alphanumeric characters.
2. patent_kind: a category to which the patent grant belongs.
3. patent_title: a title given by the inventor to the patent claim.
4. number_of_claims: an integer denoting the number of claims for a given grant.
5. citations_examiner_count: an integer denoting the number of citations made by the
examiner for a given patent grant (0 if None)
6. citations_applicant_count: an integer denoting the number of citations made by the
applicant for a given patent grant (0 if None)
7. inventors: a list of the patent inventors’ names ([NA] if the value is Null).
8. claims_text: a list of claim texts for the different patent claims ([NA] if the value is Null).
9. abstract: the patent abstract text (‘NA’ if the value is Null)

## Data
The dataset `patents.txt` contains extensive information on 150 patents.

## Output
The data is parsed in order to generate the output as describes above.

1. `patents.csv`
   
2. `patents.json`
