    "For our group, there are a total of 150 patents grants in one 16.13 KB file named `patents.txt`. The required task is to extract the data and transform the data into the CSV and JSON format with the following elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. grant_id: a unique ID for a patent grant consisting of alphanumeric characters.\n",
    "2. patent_kind: a category to which the patent grant belongs.\n",
    "3. patent_title: a title given by the inventor to the patent claim.\n",
    "4. number_of_claims: an integer denoting the number of claims for a given grant.\n",
    "5. citations_examiner_count: an integer denoting the number of citations made by the examiner for a given patent grant (0 if None)\n",
    "6. citations_applicant_count: an integer denoting the number of citations made by the applicant for a given patent grant (0 if None)\n",

To build the JSON without the use of any third part libraries, we build a string `str_json` based on our existing dataframe. We use the new lists instead of dataframe columns for the ones which potentially suffered alterations due to the special characters translation (`patent_title`, `inventors`, `claims_text` and `abstract`). <br>\n",
    "The json structure is very similar to a python dictonary, usually, a nested structure of dictonaries. However, it is not possible to create and export a dictonary in order to create  a json file and the main reason behind it is the fact that python use single quotes while json double quotes. Therefore, we are creating a string that has the json format.<br>\n",
    "Using a For loop, we are interating over the lists and the dataframe where all the data is stored, and step by steping adding to the string each of the patents. Every datatype used to built the final string has a lenght of 150, which is the number of patents we are working on. In every list, or the dataframe, the item refers to the same patent.<br>\n",
    "If we make an analogy between the final json and a dictonary, the grant_id code would be the key to access another dictonary, where the remaining relevant data from the patent is store. We sill see something like: <br> `{\"grant_id code\":{\"information1 code\": \"information1 content\", \"information2 code\": \"information2 content\"}}` <br>\n",

    "The present assignment tested our text file processing abilities in the Python programming language. The main outcomes achieved while applying these techniques were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Text Parsing and Data Extraction**. By using the `re` module, we were able to develop simple and complex regular expression patterns that were further applied to extract relevant data from the XML document. We used lots of regex resources, such as backreferences and DOTALL modifiers. Also, functions such as `search`, `sub` and `findall` were of great use to acess the data inside the document. \n",
    "- **Data Exploration**. To understand what were our goals in this assessment, there were relevant tasks regarding data exploration. One example, for instance, was to identify all special HTML characters that would have to be replaced in the document. Another example was our test to check the consistency across the `.json` and `.csv` files. For the last one, we used `pandas` dataframe methods as `DataFrame.eq`.\n",
    "- **Data manipulation**. In this assessment, almost all major data types were used: Lists, strings, sets, dictonaries, Dataframes, etc. Firstly, all the data from the file was broken in to lists. Secondly, sets and dictonaries were used to help to clean the data in those lists. Finally, when all the data was ready, it was transformed into dataframes to finally be exported to CSV.\n",
    "- **Exporting data to specific format**.  Native file operations like `open` and `write` were required where data had to be processed line by line or we couldn't use special libraries to write the JSON. Luckily, the use of Python's functions like `join()` and in-line iterators made such tasks more easy and readable. By using `pandas` function `DataFrame.to_csv()` it was possible to export data frames into a `.csv` file without additional formatting and transformations."
