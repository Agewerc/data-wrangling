This documentation refers to 4 projects developed by me and [Alan Gewerc](https://github.com/Agewerc) for the Data Wrangling unit of Monash MDS. The main topics covered on those works were:
* parse data in the required format;
* assess the quality of data for problem identification;
* resolve data quality issues ready for the data analysis process;
* integrate data sources for data enrichment;
* document the wrangling process for professional reporting;
* write program scripts for data wrangling processes.


In a nutshell, the projects were developed in Jupyter Notebook `python3` about:

   1. `parsing-data`

   2. `text-preprocessing`:
  
   Extraction of a set of published papers from nonstructured format, preprocessing  and convertion into numerical representations.



   3. `cleansing-raw-data`

   4. `data-integration-reshaping`
